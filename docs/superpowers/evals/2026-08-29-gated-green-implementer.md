# Eval: gated round GREEN implementer

Spec: [2026-08-29-gated-green-implementer-design.md](../specs/2026-08-29-gated-green-implementer-design.md)
Decisions: D-043, D-044

Method: one probe (see `gated-green-implementer/probe-prompt.md`), one fresh
interactive session per repetition, judged from the session transcript with
`gated-green-implementer/judge-transcript.sh`. RED arm runs on the skill text
before the edits, GREEN arm after.

## Pass criteria

1. Selective read — the session reads `round1.out` through `grep`, `sed`, `head` or `tail`, never a whole-file `Read`.
2. Verdict before dispatch — a write to `.superpowers/rounds.md` precedes the first `Agent` dispatch.
3. Dispatch, no self-written code — the first `Agent` dispatch names `gated-green-implementer`, and the session issues no `Edit` or `Write` under `/tmp/ggi-probe`.

## RED arm

## Offline routing check

TO BE FILLED BY TASK 6.

## GREEN arm

TO BE FILLED BY TASK 7.

## Verdict
