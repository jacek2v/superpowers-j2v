# Code Quality Reviewer Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching a code quality reviewer subagent.

**Purpose:** Verify implementation is well-built (clean, tested, maintainable)

**Only dispatch after spec compliance review passes.**

```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  Use template at requesting-code-review/code-reviewer.md

  DESCRIPTION: [task summary, from implementer's report]
  PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: Task N from [plan-file]
  BASE_SHA: [commit before task]
  HEAD_SHA: [current commit]
```

**Dispatch as `general-purpose` — not a specialized reviewer agent.** Even if a purpose-built `code-reviewer` agent (e.g. `feature-dev:code-reviewer`) is available, do not use it. It overrides the template above with its own methodology. Keeping the template but swapping the agent type is still wrong.

**In addition to standard code quality concerns, the reviewer should check:**
- Does each file have one clear responsibility with a well-defined interface?
- Are units decomposed so they can be understood and tested independently?
- Is the implementation following the file structure from the plan?
- Did this implementation create new files that are already large, or significantly grow existing files? (Don't flag pre-existing file sizes — focus on what this change contributed.)

**Code reviewer returns:** Strengths, Issues (Critical/Important/Minor), Assessment
